# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to **Codeforces** problems, written during contests and practice sessions. 
The primary purpose of this repository is **learning, revision, and personal reference**.

Most solutions are implemented in **C++**, following a personal competitive programming template.

## 📌 Details

### 🔹 Old Rounds
- Contains solutions from **past Codeforces rounds** (Div2, Div3, Educational rounds).
- Each round has its own directory.
- Problems are named as `Q1.cpp`, `Q2.cpp`, etc., or with descriptive filenames when practiced later.

### 🔹 Practice
- Contains solutions to **individual problems solved outside contests**.
- Mostly older or topic-wise practice problems.
- Filenames usually correspond to the problem name or Codeforces problem.

### 🔹 template.cpp
- My personal **competitive programming template**, used as a base for most submissions.
